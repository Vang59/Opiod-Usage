# Opioid Utilization Rates and Substance Use Disorder Trends
Kameron Thao, Mary Vang, and Sandra Braun

Introduction

According to the CDC, substance use disorders (SUDs) are treatable chronic conditions marked by an unhealthy pattern of substance use, resulting in health impairments, social dysfunction, and lack of control over substance use. This cluster of physical, behavioral, and cognitive manifestations indicates a person's continuous use of the substance in spite of harmful effects. The presence of symptoms due to substance use (drugs or alcohol) can assist providers in diagnosing a person with an SUD. The range of SUDs can range from mild to extreme, and it can affect anyone regardless of race, gender, income level, or social class. 1
Opioids are a class of drugs that bind to opioid receptors on nerve cells in the body and brain, resulting in decreased pain signals and sensations. This category of drugs consists of the illicit drug heroin; synthetics such as fentanyl, which often are manufactured and obtained illegally; and legally-obtained prescriptions like oxycodone, hydrocodone, codeine, and morphine.2
According to the CDC, in 2020 there were 40.3 million Americans aged 12 or above who had a SUD in the past year. This equates to one in seven individuals reporting the presence of a SUD.1 The CDC also reported that 2.7 million of those individuals suffered from an opioid use disorder specifically in the last year.2
It is important to note that SUDs can include alcohol, cannabis, hallucinogens, inhalants, opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, anxiolytics, stimulants, nicotine, and any other substance. These afflictions can lead to substantial obstacles in all aspects of an individual's life, including employment, education, and home life. To ensure positive results, coordinated care is paramount in treating anyone with a SUD and any simultaneous disorders, such as mental health conditions. 1
